# Singleton in Java

A Naïve Singleton in the context of Java (or any other programming language) refers to the simplest form of the Singleton design pattern. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. The "naïve" or "simple" implementation of this pattern does not take thread safety into account, making it suitable only for single-threaded applications.

Here's a basic example of a Naïve Singleton in Java:

```java
public class NaiveSingleton {
    // The sole instance of the class
    private static NaiveSingleton instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside the class
    private NaiveSingleton() {}

    // Method to return the instance of the class
    public static NaiveSingleton getInstance() {
        // If the instance doesn't exist, create it
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new NaiveSingleton();
        }
        // Return the instance
        return instance;
    }

    // Example method to demonstrate functionality
    public void showMessage() {
        System.out.println("Hello from NaiveSingleton!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get the only object available
        NaiveSingleton singleton = NaiveSingleton.getInstance();

        // Show the message
        singleton.showMessage();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `NaiveSingleton` class has a private static variable `instance` that holds the single instance of the class. The constructor is private to prevent instantiation from outside the class. The `getInstance()` method checks if `instance` is `null`, and if so, it instantiates the class and assigns the instance to the `instance` variable. This ensures that only one instance of the class is created.

However, this implementation is not thread-safe. If multiple threads try to get the instance at the same time when the instance is not yet created, it's possible for more than one instance to be created. This violates the Singleton pattern's rule that only one instance of the class should exist. For multi-threaded applications, different implementations of the Singleton pattern, such as using synchronized blocks or methods, double-checked locking, or the initialization-on-demand holder idiom, should be considered.
